Ikdoo Kim, Jaime Velez

• Originality: We're trying to show the non-human simple pvp that is side-scrolling video game.
  It will possibily have physics and uniquely we're challenging to give 2 players each control in a game.

• Technical Merit: It's interesting that we're going to create 2 players and fight each other.
  We'll consider hit-box for each characters.

• Prototype Postmortem: Currently the easiest was learning the game structure of code that exist in microStudio.
  Hardest part is editing, of course, for creating another playable character
    that should be the same logic as the existing character.

• Prototype Assets: We started with brainstorming, based on Jaime's suggestion of 'Nidhogg' gameplay.
    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dxtAfnXixs)
  And we borrowed the base game called 'Fighting pack' (https://microstudio.dev/i/Vinoue/fightingpack/).

• Prototype Closest Other Game: Because it's a side-scrolling and partially action,
  I would say it's close to one of Super Mario old versions. Code is provided by
  Fighting pack (https://microstudio.dev/i/Vinoue/fightingpack/).

• High Concept: You're a tree who's fighting to your partner tree, and the winner becomes the TreeLion
  (lion here is meaning the king of the forest).

• Theme: Challenge) Creature Feature: Create a game that is played through the eyes of any non-human creature.

• Mandated Variety: Input: character control (keypress), randomness (NOT SURE... score up can be random for fun?),
  genre (action and fighting), and play style (PVP multiplay).

• Prototype Goal: We want this prototype can provide 2 players control for fighting. (Fix here if needed)

• Player Experience Goals: Our goal of this prototype is to make users to be competitve to win.

• Gameplay: The actions are basically the same from the origin game 'Fighting Pack',
  which is close to "Martial Arts" (karate). Each character would have the same skills of punch, cover, kick,
  rotary kick, and translate (movement). Each keypress for skills would be guided before the game starts.
  If you win, we'll simply score you up 1 point, and lowly possible (randomly) to get tons of points.
  This is an easter egg that Ikdoo's only considering; if you reach to TRILLION SCORE,
  we'll present some special scenes of this game as the prize.

• Strategies: The skills are: punch, kick, kick-up, cover, rotary kick, and move.
  Thus, it requires your physical skills to win by using them as your own strategy.

• Story/Setting/Premise: In our world long-long time ago, somehow the terrible virus killed only 'animals',
  so trees are evolved and they want the basic needs like human.
  They walk, group up, and fight to win to be the king of forest.
  After you become a TreeLion, hopefully, what will happen to this tree-vilization?
  How will you control your family? Will there be any new non-human challenger to you?
    The next stories will be.... (whispering) to be continued...

• Target Audience: Whoever would like to challenge, winning a competition, and wondering how this young tree
  can be the strongest of the Earth, try out!

• Play Time: If you plan to reach trillion score, it's randomly enormous amount of time
  (we'll maybe separate mode as 'trillion mode').
  Basically my plan is the score 10 to win. If it's too short, we'll modify it.
